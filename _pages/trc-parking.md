## Design of Textile Reinforced Concrete Parking Station

### Objectives of the Project

- Developing a novel textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) material with inclined reinforcements.
- Designing a concrete-based car parking lot by using the new TRC material.

**Tools Used:** Composite production, Flexural testing, ANSYS Mechanical, SpaceClaim, MATLAB

### Materials Produced

- Different materials

### Test Results

- Test

### Design of Concrete Parking Lot

- Various loads

- Designed a parking lot for one car by optimizing new TRC material produced and tested.
- Parking lot has 2 cm thick walls which brings a novelty for sustainable design for a concrete structure.
