**Mix Design & Testing:**
- Flow tests were performed according to ASTM C230/C230M–21 for having correct workability for the placement of reinforcements
- Mix proportions (by weight):  
  - Water/Cement: 0.45  
  - Sand/Cement: 1.5  
  - Plasticizer/Cement: 0.4%  


**Reinforcement Alignments:**
- Specimens were designed with different fiber orientations:  
  - 0° (Conventional)  
  - 45° (Conventional)  
  - Inclined reinforcement layout (Novel design)

## Test Setup

- Three-point bending tests were performed using an MTS closed-loop servo-hydraulic testing machine.
- Specimen dimensions:  
  - Length: 35 cm  
  - Width: 10 cm  
  - Thickness: 2 cm  
  - Span length: 27 cm
- Testing was displacement-controlled at a rate of **2 mm/min**.

## Test Results

The flexural performance of various textile reinforcement configurations was evaluated based on their stress–strain responses. The graph and mechanical properties are presented below.

## Discussion

- The **0/90° grid configuration** exhibited clear multi-stage behavior:
  - Initial elastic and subsequent hardening regions.
- Following the ultimate stress, specimens experienced a sharp stress drop which indicates the multiple crack propagations.
- **Off-axis grid reinforcements** (30° and 45°):
  - Showed no significant hardening behavior, and presented behavior similar to ideal plasticity after the elastic limit.
- These off-axis configurations had **higher ultimate strains**, attributed to:
  - Textile pull-out.
  - Fabric rotation/scissoring effect.
- A **critical threshold angle** appears to exist above which material hardening is significantly reduced.
- Only textile alignments near the flexural direction showed progressive material hardening, with no gradual transition observed between grid angles.
- The **TT-X configuration** demonstrated superior mechanical behavior over the standard 0° grid:
  - A **17% increase in ultimate stress**.
  - A **35% improvement in tangent modulus** of the hardening region.
- These **out-of-plane reinforcements** enhanced shear resistance and crack control:
  - Delayed the formation and merging of cracks.
  - Bridged potential shear cracks by aligning perpendicular to likely crack planes.
- The cumulative effects led to:
  - **Enhanced post-crack hardening**.
  - **Improved toughness** and structural reliability of the cement-based composite.
- These benefits are expected to be even more prominent in thicker specimens with shorter span lengths, where shear effects are dominant.

## Mesh Study

Mesh optimization was conducted to ensure modeling accuracy and computational efficiency. The properties of the mesh are summarized below:

- Element Size: 22 mm  
- Element Type: Shell Element  
- Element Geometry: Quadratic  
- Symmetric Meshing at the Legs of the Structure

## Critical Loads and Stress Distribution

The structural analysis followed the TS 487 Design Code, considering the following load combination:

- Critical Load Combination: **1.2D + 1.6L + 0.8W**
- Uniform Thickness of Structural Elements: **64 mm**

## Strain and Crack Check

- Maximum Principal and Normal Strains have been checked  
- Strains are in the Elastic Range for both used configurations

## Buckling Control

- Eigenvalue Buckling Analysis was performed  
- 4 Buckling Modes were investigated
