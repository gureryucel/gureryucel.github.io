## Design of Textile Reinforced Concrete Parking Station

### Project Aims and Motivation

- Developing a novel designed high-performance textile reinforced concrete (TRC) material
- Comparing flexural behavior with conventional TRC designs
- Designing a concrete parking station consisting of TRC materials, targeting building applications and promoting sustainability

### Specimen Production

**Concrete Matrix Materials:**
- Portland cement (CEM I 42.5 R)
- Natural sand
- Polycarboxylate-based plasticizer (Sika Viscocrete Hi-tech 3073)
- Tap water

**Reinforcement Details:**
- Grid-shaped aligned glass fiber bundles with epoxy coating  
- Density: 2.7 g/cm³  
- Elastic Modulus: 78 GPa  
- Tensile Strength: 1.7 GPa  
- Grid size: 10 mm × 10 mm  
- Thickness: 3 mm

**Mix Design & Testing:**
- Mix proportions (by weight):  
  - Water/Cement: 0.45  
  - Sand/Cement: 1.5  
  - Plasticizer/Cement: 0.4%  
- Flow tests performed according to ASTM C230/C230M–21 for workability to ensure correct placement of reinforcements

**Reinforcement Alignments:**
- Specimens were designed with different fiber orientations:  
  - 0° (Conventional)  
  - 45° (Conventional)  
  - Inclined reinforcement layout (Novel design)

### Test Results

- Flexural testing was conducted on all specimens
- The inclined reinforcement design showed improved load-carrying behavior compared to conventional TRC designs
- Load–deflection curves were analyzed using MATLAB

### Design of Concrete Parking Station

- Structural design included multiple load cases representing a small car
- A parking station was designed using the novel inclined TRC material
- Structural modeling was performed in **ANSYS Mechanical** and geometry prepared in **SpaceClaim**
- Final design featured **2 cm thick walls**, significantly reducing concrete usage

> This design highlights a **sustainable solution** for concrete-based applications using textile reinforcement technology.
