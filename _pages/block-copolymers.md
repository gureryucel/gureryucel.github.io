## Behavior of Block-Co-Polymers in Different Solvents

### Summary of objective and methods
- Coarse-grained MD simulations of PS, PEO, and PS-b-PEO.
- Behavior of the polymers in different solvents as water, octane, and water/octane mixtures.
- Polymer configurations and micelle formation are the main focus.

**Tools Used:** GROMACS, MATLAB, OriginPro

### Chemical Structures
Please refer to the figure below for the chemical structures of the polymers:

### Research Question 1
**What is the behavior of PS, PEO, and PS-b-PEO in water as a solvent?**

- Analyzed the behavior of a block co-polymer (PS-b-PEO) in water and octane solvents, searching micelle formations.
