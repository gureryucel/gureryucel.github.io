Hi, I am Can GÃ¼rer YÃ¼cel. I am currently a Master's Student in the Fibre and Polymer Engineering program and the Strength Analysis of Advanced Structures advanced minor program at Aalto University. I hold my Bachelor's degree in both Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering at BoÄŸaziÃ§i University, a highly prestigious school with most students scoring 0.1% on the nationwide exam. 


I see myself as a computational scientist and engineer:) I am specialized and have expertise in particle-based simulations (Molecular dynamics method) and continuum models (Finite Element Method). I have completed my Master's thesis (\link) on molecular modeling simulations about water interactions in polymer-azobenzene photoactive complexes. My bachelor's thesis contains both experimental and computational studies on novel designed textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) materials. Additionally, I have research experience on the rheology of cement paste and mortar for 3D printing applications. 


Currently, I am looking for possible doctoral study opportunities mostly in the computational science and engineering field. Please feel free to browse other pages in my website ðŸ˜Š
