Hi, I am Can Gürer Yücel. I am a Master's Student in Fibre and Polymer Engineering program at Aalto University School of Chemical Engineering. I am specialized in molecular modeling of polymers, and aim to develop myself in material modeling. I hold my Bachelor's degree in both Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering at Boğaziçi University, a highly prestigious school with most students scoring 0.1% on the nationwide exam.
